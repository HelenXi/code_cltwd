# code_cltwd

This is a package of codes used for computing variants of sliced Wasserstein distance between high-dimensional distributions and verify the uniform CLT of sliced Wasserstein process. 
Several examples are given, including uniform distribution over spheres, ellipsoids, and two disconnected balls.
A bootstrapping procedure is implemented to obtain confidence intervals where the limiting distributions lie in.
